# queue-runner.sh — sequential autoloop queue processor
#
# Reads plans/queue (ordered list, one plan dir per line).
# Skips plans whose autoloop branch already has STATUS: DONE in progress.md.
# Runs the first pending plan via run-batch.sh (or $RUNNER if overridden).
#
# Safe to call repeatedly from a systemd timer — idempotent on an empty/all-done queue.
#
# Queue format (plans/queue):
#   plans/marketing-agents      ← pending (runs next)
#   plans/pipeline-safeguards   ← pending (runs after marketing-agents)
#   # comments and blank lines ignored
#
# To add a plan:  echo "plans/my-plan" >> plans/queue  then commit + push
# To skip a plan: prefix the line with #
# To re-run a done plan: delete its autoloop/<plan> branch and re-run
#
# Post-June-15-2026: set RUNNER=./run-once.sh in rolliq-autoloop.service
# and the queue runner picks it up automatically.
